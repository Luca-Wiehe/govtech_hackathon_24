# GovMatch
GovMatch is a matching platform for employees of the Swiss government. It seeks to connect people from different locations, break up local and departmental structures, and ultimately enable coworkers to network more efficiently than ever before. This project was developed in a 30-hour period as part of the #GovTechHack24 hackathon. The main component is an iOS application that can be extended with a DjangoRestAPI to allow a permanent storage of user data on a central server.
